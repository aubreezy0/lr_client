## What is Lunchbx?

Lunchbx is an app that lets hangry people outsource their lunch decisions.

By lunchtime you’re hangry, and the last thing you want to do is pick where to eat. In its final iteration, Lunchbx is a neighborhood restaurant randomizer that makes the decision for you! Anyone can visit at any time. Creating an account allows you to add and edit your own restaurants to customize your random lunchtime experience!

## Planning

Considerable time was spent fleshing out the user stories, ERDs, and wireframes, which made for a project that moved more efficiently than past projects.

### User Stories
I had fun writing the users stories. Lunchbx is actually solving a problem I complained aboutfor years. The stories give hints of people I've know over the years...

## What’s Next?

Where do we go from here? That's an easy one!

### Onwards... towards the original vision:

<ul>
<li>Location-based responses</li>
<li>Foursquare API</li>
<li>Ability to create custom lists, or exclude results</li>
<li>Ability for teams to create and share their own lists</li>
<li>Add reviews, notes</li>
<li>Pandora-style AI that tracks and weights popular choices</li>
</ul>

### ...but, realistically speaking…
My most immediate (very modest) goals are:
<ul>
<li>Auto sign-in after sign-up</li>
<li>Add restaurant randomizer</li>
<li>Styling</li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS/SASS
JavaScript
